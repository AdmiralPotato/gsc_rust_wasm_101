		<h1>Look in the console for output.</h1>
		<p>Q: Why is the output in the console instead of on the page?</p>
		<p>A: Because some of the output there is expandable/explorable objects and I didn't want to try and display complex objects in the DOM right now.</p>
		<p>If you don't see any output there, you may need to run this page from an HTTP server.</p>
